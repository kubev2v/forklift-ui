# forklift-ui

Forklift UI - VMware to OpenShift Virtualization migration tool

A read-only preview with mock data is available at http://konveyor-forklift-ui-preview.surge.sh/.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 16.x

## Quick-start

Clone and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/konveyor/forklift-ui
cd forklift-ui
npm run install:ws # Installs all workspaces packages and the top level packages
```

Create a meta.dev.json file in the config directory using [`config/meta.dev.example.json`](./config/meta.dev.example.json) as a template. Set the `inventoryApi` property to the root URL of your forklift-controller inventory API, and set the `clusterApi` property to the root URL of your host OpenShift cluster API. And also to be able to use VMware provider data to be analysed by Migration Analytics set the `inventoryPayloadApi` property to the root URL of your forklift-controller inventory Payload API.

### Environment variables

- `DATA_SOURCE` - either `mock` or `remote`
  (unnecessary if you use `npm run [start:dev|build]:[mock|remote]` scripts)
- `META_FILE` path (for running in prod mode with `npm run start`)
- `BRAND_TYPE` - either `Konveyor` (default) or `RedHat`

Run the UI with webpack-dev-server at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000):

```sh
npm run start:dev:remote  # uses data from the API URLs in your config/meta.dev.json file
npm run start:dev:mock    # uses static mock data, can run offline
npm run start:dev         # uses the DATA_SOURCE environment variable (remote or mock)
```

## Development Scripts

To run the type-checker, linter and unit tests:

```sh
# Run all 3:
npm run ci
# Or run them individually:
npm run type-check
npm run lint # or lint:fix to automatically fix certain issues
npm run test # or test:watch to auto-rerun tests on file changes
```

Note: the `npm run test` script will create a coverage report at `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`. This is useful to inspect locally before opening a PR.

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatting is enforced by ESLint. To run Prettier and format your code (do this before committing if you don't run Prettier in your editor):

```sh
npm run format
```

To run a production build using webpack (outputs to `./dist`):

```sh
npm run build:remote  # uses data from the API URLs in meta.json (path set by META_FILE)
npm run build:mock    # uses static mock data, can run offline or be deployed as a preview
npm run build         # uses the DATA_SOURCE environment variable (remote or mock)
```

To launch a tool for inspecting the bundle size:

```sh
npm run bundle-profile:analyze
```

## Running in production mode (run a build first)

```sh
npm run start
```

## Configurations

- [TypeScript Config](./tsconfig.json)
- [Webpack Config](./webpack.common.js)
- [Jest Config](./jest.config.js)
- [Editor Config](./.editorconfig)

### Import paths

TypeScript is configured to allow importing modules by their absolute path. The prefix `@app/` is an alias for the main `src/app/` directory.

For example:

```ts
import { PROVIDER_TYPE_NAMES } from '@app/common/constants';
```

In general, we should use relative paths `../` when they make sense for co-located files, and absolute paths for things located near the root. The goal is to avoid long and hard-to-read relative paths.
